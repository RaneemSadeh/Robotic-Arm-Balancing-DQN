# Robotic-Arm-Balancing-DQN
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model designed to control a robotic arm in the "Pendulum-v1" environment from the Gymnasium library by OpenAI. The project focuses on training a neural network to balance a pendulum (simulating a robotic arm) using reinforcement learning techniques.
